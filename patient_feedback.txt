It wasn't a good experience, I booked my appointment in advance and the day before they contacted me to cancel because Dr. Leandro was having particular problems (no problems).

They rescheduled days later and rescheduled the day before once again.

Conclusion, now I was ignored on WhatsApp and left without a consultation. Huge waste of time.
