My daughter had her first appointment with Ms. Sauerbrey. Everyone was talking about a suicide case in their circle of friends. In my opinion, Ms. Sauerbrey has shown herself to be incompetent. It was clear that a young person cannot immediately open up emotionally at the initial interview, especially when it comes to the death of a friend. The therapist hurt my daughter even more by calling her “aloof” and then giving me an “explanation” that it was probably due to my daughter’s “Eastern European” origins. It's actually the case that my daughter is half German and half Eastern European. Now I find it unprofessional to make such a statement to the child who is currently looking for answers to his friend's suicide. It hurt her and me very much.
