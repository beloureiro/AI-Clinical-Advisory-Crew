I went with great expectations, but I felt that there was a lack of a more attentive and investigative approach, I wrote a report on the symptoms, as we were certainly nervous and ended up forgetting details, but I felt that there was a lack of good will. I did not like and agreed with the approach to care and past guidelines, I still felt that these guidelines were not satisfactory and I expected more information. It all happened very quickly.  I reported that I was trying to get pregnant and I didn't feel heard or informed. I've never felt so bad in a consultation. I spent the day feeling terrible and crying. Unfortunately I don't recommend it. A shame because it's not free, we're paying. (Apart from the secretary who has no empathy or kindness. You talk and she doesn't respond. But anyway, never again.
