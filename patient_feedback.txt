When I arrived at the office, at the time scheduled for me, there were more than 10 people still waiting to be seen! So I asked the secretary to cancel my appointment! How could I serve all those people in such a short time, it was already 3:30 pm! I thought it was disrespectful to schedule so many patients at the same time! And such a delay in responding! How long would each consultation last? It was disappointing to have to give up, time, traffic, paid parking, and having to leave!
