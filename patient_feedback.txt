Be careful when looking for a couples therapist, look for someone who really believes in marriage, after all, if we seek therapy for couples it is because we want to improve the relationship.
I paid to get divorced in the first therapy, “The worst of all the violence you can commit with a patient is to understand him too quickly” - Lacan
If you want to restore your marriage, look for a Christian therapist who believes in restoration. She looked at my husband and without understanding his side of the story put him in check to ask for a divorce. If we are looking for therapy, it is obvious that we are thinking about separation, but we are there to see the good side of marriage with the correct mediation. I don't recommend it!
