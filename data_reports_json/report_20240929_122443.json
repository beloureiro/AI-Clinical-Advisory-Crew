    "patient_feedback": "I went to the Vitali clinic to specialize in psychology, I was treated by Estefanía. At no point did I know that the duration of the session was 30 minutes (which is why I didn't listen to her but to the clinic itself) from the beginning she had prejudices about my supposed diagnosis, pigeonholing me into stereotypes and assigning me attributes without even knowing me. He began asking me questions about an episode where my physical integrity was severely compromised, making me feel like I was to blame and that it was somehow justified. Then he told me that he already knew my diagnosis as soon as he saw me by the way I dressed... finally he told me that he couldn't do much more for me.  A person seeking help who has thoughts and history of a life-threatening nature (I can't use words here) and receives this treatment is... After your visit he becomes much worse. That is why I am encouraged to share my experience.",

Implement immediate measures for apology to Estefanía with sincere acknowledgment of her mistakes during the session concerning appearance biases, invasive questioning about past experiences and lack of trauma sensitivity—this step is essential in beginning healing from any distrust or emotional harm caused by professional misconduct. 2. Organize mandatory cultural competence workshops for all psychologists at Vitali clinic to prevent recurrence, with a focus on understanding diverse backgrounds and avoiding appearance-based assumptions that might influence patient care; this step ensures continuous education in ethical practice standards across the team which is vital. 3. Integrate trauma sensitivity protocol into session guidelines—include steps such as building rapport prior to discussions about sensitive topics, obtaining clear consent before exploring a client's past experiences and regularly checking for patient comfort levels; this provides structure that respects patients’ boundaries while allowing necessary dialogue where appropriate. 4. Establish an ongoing review process post-session involving both clinician self-evaluation of bias awareness, feedback from clients (where possible), to foster improvement in psychologist conduct and interaction quality—this step encourages accountability through reflection which is key for professional growth within a healthcare setting that values patient emotional wellbeing. 5. Provide accessibility to additional resources like counselors or support groups aimed at discussions around bias reduction among staff members, reinforcing trauma-informed care principles—this final step solidifies the approach of creating an empathetic clinic environment where all patients feel heard and respected regardless of their personal experiences.",
