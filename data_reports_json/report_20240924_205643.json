The receiver was picked up and obviously placed next to the telephone (a few minutes). I dialed several more times and it wasn't picked up. Other patients probably know this problem. \nThere is nothing known that makes it conceivable as the cause of this strange behavior. I could imagine that this strange behavior is an initiative of the Polish receptionist. These conditions pose a risk to patients. The medical association, the health insurance company and also the public prosecutor must be informed of these things.",

                "Suggested_Approach_Clinical_Psychologist": "First, empathetically discuss the patient's feelings and experiences. Allow them to express their full range of emotions.; Validate that it is very concerning to have repeated calls go unanswered when trying to contact a medical office for necessary prescriptions.; Reassure them that their concerns are legitimate and they should not feel dismissed or ignored in this process.; Second, explore what impact this lack of response has had on the patient's mental well-being. Are they feeling increasingly anxious, frustrated, worried it means bigger issues?; Offer strategies to cope with these heightened emotions, like deep breathing, mindfulness exercises to calm the mind and body.; Suggest they try other means of contact if phone calls are still not working - send a letter, visit in person to speak with staff directly.; Additional, have them write down everything about this experience in detail. Getting it out of their head and onto paper can help release some of those pent up feelings and make them feel heard.; Encourage reaching out for support to family or friends if needed to help weather this difficult period as well. The key is showing genuine concern, being actively empathetic, validating the situation's impact and helping find a path through these emotions. The main goal is to keep the patient feeling seen, validated and supported rather than dismissed or ignored in their time of need which would only make things worse. Empathy, reassurance and proactive support are key when someone is feeling frustrated and worried about their medical care."

Regular training on professional telephone etiquette and customer service should be provided. Implementing a call-back system would significantly improve patient experience and reduce potential misunderstandings or perceived neglect. Additionally, encouraging open dialogue between patients and staff about such issues can help address concerns promptly and prevent escalation."
