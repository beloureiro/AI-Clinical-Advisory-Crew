It is very difficult to talk to him, as he does not understand that hearing impaired people cannot hear him when he is wearing a mask, as many rely on lip reading. I had two bad experiences with him; he seems to think hearing impaired people are crazy. He does not meet the expectations of being a specialist in caring for people with disabilities. Furthermore, there is an obvious lack of care, with significant delays in services, causing people to wait for hours on end. Your ethical conduct is terrible!",
