Service without empathy, very fast and focused only on medicines, without looking at the whole picture and not just obesity.  Since obesity is a disease and can be acquired in several ways, not just eating too much. I'm tired of looking only at the fat and not how it came about!!! Finally, a very old-fashioned and unempathetic doctor!!!",

This delay highlights inefficient appointment management, leading to a negative experience characterized by lack of empathy from the doctor towards obesity and its various contributing factors rather than just focusing on weight loss through medication.\n\nImprovement suggestions include:\n1. Introducing an automated system for scheduling that accommodates potential delays and ensures appointments are punctual.\n2. Developing standardized protocols during medical consultations to encourage doctors to explore all aspects related to obesity, beyond simple weight concerns.\n3. Providing continuous training or workshops to healthcare professionals on empathy, active listening skills, and understanding the complex nature of obesity as a disease.\n\nThese recommendations aim to address inefficiencies in patient care and enhance overall satisfaction by prioritizing a holistic approach to managing patients with obesity-related issues."

They feel unheard and misunderstood, leading to a sense of powerlessness. There's also likely underlying sadness and possibly shame related to their weight.\n\nSupport_Strategy_Clinical_Psychologist: Empathetic validation of their feelings is crucial. Building trust and rapport through active listening will help the patient feel seen and understood.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques can be used to challenge negative thought patterns surrounding their body image and medical experience. \n\nSuggested_Approach_Clinical_Psychologist:\n- Begin by acknowledging and validating the patient's feelings of frustration and anger regarding their medical experience. \n- Actively listen to their concerns about feeling dismissed and the lack of holistic care.  \n- Introduce CBT techniques to help them reframe negative thoughts and beliefs about their body and weight.\n- Explore healthy coping mechanisms for managing stress and anxiety related to their experiences.\n- Encourage open communication and collaboration in developing a personalized treatment plan that addresses both physical and emotional needs."
