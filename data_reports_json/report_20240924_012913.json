    "patient_feedback": "Catastrophe since Fr. Dr. Sommerfeld is no longer there. A helper seems hard-working and competent. The others sitting at the front are loudly having private conversations or phone calls. For example, when is the next nail appointment? Then of course there is no time to answer the phone. Ms. Dr. Breitwieser seems to want to choose her patients carefully. I tried to give this lady a leap of faith several times, each time in vain. Very condescending, very dismissive, zero empathy. My family had the same impressions. You couldn't even look at the entry of the last appointment shortly beforehand and so you didn't know at all what was discussed at the last appointment. Sometimes it becomes very rude. Like you're a stupid little child. If you have high blood pressure, you can't even measure your blood pressure on site if you have acute symptoms. Just a small excerpt of all the very disappointing and unpleasant things I had to experience there.",
