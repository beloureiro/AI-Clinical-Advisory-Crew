Ms. Dr. Despite an appointment, Jach turned me away without treatment because I had my children with me. “She needs rest” was the only reason. My newborn was in the stroller sleeping and my three-year-old was sitting in the corner with a book reading. Seriously, how much more rest do you need?!! Thank you for wasting my time, as a mother you have so much of it.",

Celebrate her resilience.; If she feels ready, explore coping strategies like journaling, support groups with other mothers, or hobbies that bring her joy and help offset stress. Encourage her to keep making time for self-care.; Gradually shift focus towards fostering self-compassion. Challenge any beliefs that being a mother means always putting others first at her own expense. Help her see the importance of prioritizing her mental health too. The patient's emotional state reveals a significant wound from being judged and denied care due to societal stigma against mothers. The support strategy must prioritize validating those feelings, praising resilience, and fostering self-compassion. By creating a safe space to express frustrations while also celebrating her strength, we can begin to heal this deep pain. Slowly shifting focus towards cultivating empathy for oneself is key for long-term emotional recovery from motherhood stigma."
