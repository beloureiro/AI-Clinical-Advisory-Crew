Service without empathy, very fast and focused only on medicines, without looking at the whole picture and not just obesity.  Since obesity is a disease and can be acquired in several ways, not just eating too much. I'm tired of looking only at the fat and not how it came about!!! Finally, a very old-fashioned and unempathetic doctor!!!",
