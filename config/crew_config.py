# Instructions:
# If you are using the sequential process (default):
#   - Ensure the manager_agent is included both in the imports and in the agents list.
# If you are using the hierarchical process:
#   - Comment out the manager_agent in the imports and in the agents list, and instead specify it in the manager_agent parameter within the Crew configuration.
