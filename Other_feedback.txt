Since my daughter has started treatment with her, there have been two canceled appointments and three delays of more than an hour.
Thus it is impossible to obtain effectiveness and continuity in a treatment.
I do not dispute that you have reasons to be absent, but if your attendance or availability at work is not possible, you should think about reorganizing your appointments.
Very disappointed with the service of this professional, who has not given me time to get to know her way of working or the quality of it.

Absolute lack of interest in the patient's evolution and worsening.

I don't understand this doctor. I think it is a problem with the language.

Because in a mistake I claimed that I still had medication, I paid the 50 euros and the refund rejected it for having another pre-written one and the aforementioned refuses to return the 50 euros for something that has done nothing, I just wish that she would die for being a miser. Two-legged rat who prefers to defraud a client of supposedly his vocation, I hope you die a slow death, so I will defer the 50 euros that you defrauded me. "Bitch"

I leave this note because this girl has treated me for more than 6 years, a great disappointment of little objectivity and little empathy after so many years, a shame, I feel deceived and this is how I express it. A great disappointment and very little professionalism on the part of the professional.

Zero empathy. It's the first time I've felt uncomfortable in a consultation.

I went to the Vitali clinic to specialize in psychology, I was treated by Estefan√≠a. At no point did I know that the duration of the session was 30 minutes (which is why I didn't listen to her but to the clinic itself) from the beginning she had prejudices about my supposed diagnosis, pigeonholing me into stereotypes and assigning me attributes without even knowing me. He began asking me questions about an episode where my physical integrity was severely compromised, making me feel like I was to blame and that it was somehow justified. Then he told me that he already knew my diagnosis as soon as he saw me by the way I dressed... finally he told me that he couldn't do much more for me.  A person seeking help who has thoughts and history of a life-threatening nature (I can't use words here) and receives this treatment is... After your visit he becomes much worse. That is why I am encouraged to share my experience.

I went because of shoulder pain and I didn't look or touch the area. I practically don't even look at his face. Ibuprofen and taking it for granted... Regrettable

Disastrous Lack of empathy, closeness, kindness and professionalism, a waste of money.

That the dentist did nothing and did not try to treat the child.

When I arrived at the medical center they informed me that the doctor was not going to come and no one informed me. A day before he had confirmed the visit. Terrible. Luckily, the staff at the medical center informed me of everything very kindly, but Doctoralia's service was very poor.

Unfortunately, the doctor did not appear during an ONLINE consultation.
