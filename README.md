# AI Clinical Advisory Crew

## Description
This project implements a system for analyzing and improving patient experience in healthcare environments, using a team of specialized AI agents. The system processes patient feedback, analyzes healthcare processes, evaluates emotional states, and proposes improvements in communication and processes. 

A key feature of this project is the flexibility to swap out different LLM (Large Language Model) configurations for testing various outputs. Each agent can utilize a different LLM, allowing for the combination of multiple agents with distinct models in the process, enhancing the overall analysis and recommendations.

# AI Clinical Advisory Crew Report Structure

The report generated by the AI Clinical Advisory Crew is structured to provide a comprehensive analysis of patient feedback and recommendations for improvement. Each report is divided into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of the patient experience and the healthcare process:

1. **Patient Feedback**: 
   - This section captures the patient's experience in their own words, detailing specific issues encountered during their interaction with the healthcare provider.

2. **Agent Analysis**: 
   - Each specialized agent provides their analysis based on the patient feedback. The agents include:
     - **Patient Experience Expert**: Focuses on the emotional impact of the experience and identifies key issues.
     - **Health & IT Process Expert**: Analyzes the patient journey, identifies inefficiencies, and suggests process improvements.
     - **Clinical Psychologist**: Assesses the emotional state of the patient and recommends support strategies.
     - **Communication Expert**: Evaluates the quality of communication and identifies areas for improvement.
     - **Manager and Advisor**: Provides a consolidated communication report with actionable recommendations.

3. **Final Recommendations**: 
   - Each agent concludes with specific recommendations aimed at improving the patient experience, communication, and overall service quality.

4. **Execution Time**: 
   - The report concludes with the total execution time taken to generate the report.
## Agents
The project utilizes five specialized agents:

1. Patient Experience Expert
2. Health & IT Process Expert
3. Clinical Psychologist
4. Communication Expert
5. Manager and Advisor

Each agent has a specific role in analyzing and improving the patient experience.
