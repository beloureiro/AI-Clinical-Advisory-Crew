- Collaborate with healthcare providers or administrators to develop a more reliable appointment system. This could include implementing an automated notification system for changes in the patient's schedule and offering alternative time slots as options when conflicts arise (Step 2 if necessary, otherwise proceed directly to Step 3).

Provide resources like apps or handouts on these practices for them to practice independently at home and before appointments (Step 4, potentially expandable with additional steps if needed).
- Educate the patient about setting healthy boundaries in their care journey; this includes advocating effectively when they need changes made by medical staff. Empowerment through knowledge can help mitigate feelings of helplessness and build resilience against future disruptions (Step 5, with possible additional steps like role-playing scenarios or creating a personal action plan).
  These approaches are designed to address the emotional impact directly by validating patient experiences, enhancing communication systems between healthcare providers and patients for more predictable scheduling, equipping the patient with stress management tools they can access independently of their clinical environment, and empowering them through education on advocacy within a medical setting.

Implement immediate measures for apology to Estefanía with sincere acknowledgment of her mistakes during the session concerning appearance biases, invasive questioning about past experiences and lack of trauma sensitivity—this step is essential in beginning healing from any distrust or emotional harm caused by professional misconduct. 2. Organize mandatory cultural competence workshops for all psychologists at Vitali clinic to prevent recurrence, with a focus on understanding diverse backgrounds and avoiding appearance-based assumptions that might influence patient care; this step ensures continuous education in ethical practice standards across the team which is vital. 3. Integrate trauma sensitivity protocol into session guidelines—include steps such as building rapport prior to discussions about sensitive topics, obtaining clear consent before exploring a client's past experiences and regularly checking for patient comfort levels; this provides structure that respects patients’ boundaries while allowing necessary dialogue where appropriate. 4. Establish an ongoing review process post-session involving both clinician self-evaluation of bias awareness, feedback from clients (where possible), to foster improvement in psychologist conduct and interaction quality—this step encourages accountability through reflection which is key for professional growth within a healthcare setting that values patient emotional wellbeing. 5.
