report_20240924_090703,3 minutes and 16 seconds,"By far the worst medical care I've had in my life. I was treated with complete indifference. I arrived ahead of schedule, but I saw the Dr leave upon my arrival to deal with personal matters. More than half an hour later he returned to my appointment, in which he must not have spoken 5 words. The consultation itself didn't last 1 minute. The doctor interrupted me while I was speaking, or rather, trying to explain what I was feeling. Even before finishing, he gave me an ineligible prescription without explaining what it was, without saying what it could be, or what I felt could be X or Y, etc... he ordered an exam (ineligible) and then look for a hospital. Hey!?! If your health plan, like mine, has scheduled an appointment with this doctor, my suggestion is that you look for another one immediately.",Negative,-0.95,High,"Key_Issues_Patient_Experience_Expert:; Doctor's indifference and rude behavior, including leaving during the appointment and interrupting the patient.; Lack of communication regarding prescriptions and further examinations ordered by the doctor.",,,,"The patient expresses feelings of anger, frustration,  disrespect, and helplessness.
