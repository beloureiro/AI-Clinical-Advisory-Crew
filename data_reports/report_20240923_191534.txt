## Final Answer:
The patient's journey was marked by delays in clinic arrival time without explanation, leading to frustration. Inadequate communication about results from an eye tomography test and a lack of understanding resulted in dissatisfaction and confusion. To improve this process:
1) Implementing a system for tracking clinic arrival times will provide patients with estimated wait times upon booking appointments.
2) Enhancing training programs for healthcare providers to improve their communication skills and knowledge of medical procedures ensures they can confidently explain results and next steps in patient care.
3) Developing internal policies that mandate clear referral processes when directing patients to other specialists or departments includes automated email notifications with next appointment details and instructions on what to expect, ensuring patient continuity.
