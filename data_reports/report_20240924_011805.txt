# AI Clinical Advisory Crew Report

Patient Feedback: Catastrophe since Fr. Dr. Sommerfeld is no longer there. A helper seems hard-working and competent. The others sitting at the front are loudly having private conversations or phone calls. For example, when is the next nail appointment? Then of course there is no time to answer the phone. Ms. Dr. Breitwieser seems to want to choose her patients carefully. I tried to give this lady a leap of faith several times, each time in vain. Very condescending, very dismissive, zero empathy. My family had the same impressions. You couldn't even look at the entry of the last appointment shortly beforehand and so you didn't know at all what was discussed at the last appointment. Sometimes it becomes very rude. Like you're a stupid little child. If you have high blood pressure, you can't even measure your blood pressure on site if you have acute symptoms. Just a small excerpt of all the very disappointing and unpleasant things I had to experience there.

# Agent: Health & IT Process Expert
## Final Answer:
The patient's journey involves multiple touchpoints starting from initial contact with the facility or reception desk. Key inefficiencies include unprofessional conduct by front desk staff and insensitivity in care provided by Ms. Dr. Breitwieser. Improvement suggestions aim to enhance customer service skills for all staff, monitor and address attitudes through regular evaluations, and improve electronic health record access to ensure continuous patient care.

# Agent: Clinical Psychologist
## Final Answer:
Emotional_State_Clinical_Psychologist: The patient expresses feelings of anger, frustration, disappointment, and a sense of powerlessness.  They are likely experiencing stress due to the perceived lack of professionalism and empathy from the staff, which is negatively impacting their overall well-being.

Support_Strategy_Clinical_Psychologist: Validate the patient's feelings by actively listening and acknowledging their concerns. Provide reassurance that their experiences are valid and offer support in coping with the emotional distress caused by these interactions.

Suggested_Approach_Clinical_Psychologist:
- Help the patient identify specific coping mechanisms to manage stress and anxiety related to their healthcare experiences (e.g., relaxation techniques, mindfulness exercises). 
- Explore alternative healthcare providers or options if the patient feels unsafe or uncomfortable continuing with the current practice.
- Encourage the patient to advocate for themselves by communicating their concerns clearly and respectfully to relevant staff members or administrators.

Suggested_Improvements_Communication_Expert:

- Provide training on active listening, empathy, and respectful communication to all staff members

Final_Recommendation_Communication_Expert: The practice urgently needs to address these communication issues through comprehensive staff training, clear protocols, and a renewed focus on patient-centered care.
