Patient Feedback: NEVER AGAIN! I don't criticize the doctor himself. Unfortunately, we were already rejected at the reception. Despite the emergency (retinal detachment), they didn't want to accept us. We were told that we didn't know whether that was really the case and that the family doctors would tell us a lot.  They then wanted to clarify with the doctor whether they wanted to see my husband at all, since I argued with them and they found it very disturbing... and then disappeared... then came back with the statement that it can take a long time... at least 1.5 hours.... The two ladies couldn't be topped in terms of unfriendliness, lack of empathy and unprofessionalism. We then drove to the eye clinic. There was a correct response to the diagnosis and my husband was treated immediately. By the way, always friendly and empathetic!
