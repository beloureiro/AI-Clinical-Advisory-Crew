### Consolidated Psychological Support Analysis
* Emotional State:  Based on the feedback, the patient's emotional state can be described as feeling **disrespected, humiliated, and unwelcome**. The lengthy wait time likely contributed to feelings of frustration and impatience, which were then exacerbated by the perceived rudeness and inattentiveness of the healthcare provider. This interaction likely resulted in a significant negative impact on her overall well-being and perception of healthcare. 
* Support Strategy:  A tailored support strategy should focus on validating the patient's feelings and addressing the specific concerns raised. It is crucial to acknowledge that her experience was not acceptable and that her feelings are understandable given the circumstances. Reassure her that her feedback will be taken seriously and used to improve future experiences for other patients.
* Suggested Approach:  The following approach can be employed to provide emotional support:

    1. **Empathetic Validation:** Begin by acknowledging and validating the patient's emotions: "I understand that you felt disrespected, humiliated, and unwelcome during your visit. Those are not feelings anyone should experience when seeking healthcare." 
    2. **Apology & Accountability:** Offer a sincere apology for the negative experience and acknowledge responsibility for the shortcomings: "I am truly sorry for what you went through. We strive to provide compassionate and respectful care to all our patients, and clearly, we fell short of that in your case."
    3. **Active Listening:** Listen attentively to her concerns without interrupting or offering solutions prematurely. Demonstrate genuine interest in understanding her perspective.
    4. **Problem-Solving Collaboration:**  Involve the patient in identifying potential solutions to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. Ask for her input and suggestions on how the healthcare facility can improve its services. 
    5. **Action Plan & Follow-Up:** Outline specific steps that will be taken to address her concerns and implement improvements. Offer a follow-up appointment to ensure her satisfaction with the changes made.


  This approach aims to create a safe space for the patient to express her feelings, feel heard and understood, and regain trust in the healthcare system.

    1. **Lack of Respect and Empathy:** The healthcare provider demonstrated a lack of respect and empathy towards the patient, making her feel uncomfortable and insignificant.
