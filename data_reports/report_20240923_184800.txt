## Final Answer:
Emotional_State_Clinical_Psychologist: The patient is likely experiencing feelings of anger, frustration, sadness, and possibly a sense of powerlessness.  The rude and dismissive communication from the specialist has undoubtedly damaged their trust in the healthcare system and created a negative association with seeking medical help.

Support_Strategy_Clinical_Psychologist: The primary support strategy should focus on validating the patient's feelings, building rapport, and empowering them to advocate for their needs in future interactions. 

Suggested_Approach_Clinical_Psychologist:
- **Active Listening and Validation:** Begin by actively listening to the patient's experience without judgment. Validate their feelings of anger, frustration, and hurt caused by the specialist's behavior. Phrases like "It sounds like you felt disrespected and unheard," can demonstrate empathy and understanding. 
- **Empowerment and Advocacy:**  Help the patient develop coping mechanisms for dealing with challenging medical encounters. Discuss strategies for assertive communication, such as clearly stating their needs and expectations to healthcare providers. Provide information about patient rights and resources available for addressing complaints against healthcare professionals.
