Patient Feedback: I am very disappointed, something like this has never happened to me in practice. He saw me in less than 5 minutes and when I asked him about my daughter's condition, he didn't want to explain to me why it was an acu consultation (acu consultation is 7-8 minutes). He downplayed my concern and also stood up and opened the door for me to leave quickly. He treated me with indifference and scared my daughter by giving her a diagnosis that would last for a year. My daughter left in tears.
