# Agent: Clinical Psychologist
## Final Answer:
Emotional_State_Clinical_Psychologist: The patient expresses feelings of frustration, anger, and disappointment. They likely feel unheard, neglected, and dissatisfied with the lack of attention and information received during their appointment. This experience could lead to decreased trust in healthcare providers and anxiety about seeking future medical care. 
Support_Strategy_Clinical_Psychologist:  A supportive and empathetic approach is crucial. Validating their feelings, acknowledging their right to receive quality care, and providing reassurance that their concerns are understandable are important first steps. Cognitive-behavioral techniques can be helpful to address negative thought patterns and replace them with more constructive ones.  

Suggested_Approach_Clinical_Psychologist:
- **Active Listening:** Begin by actively listening to the patient's experience, allowing them to fully express their feelings and frustrations without interruption. 
- **Empathy and Validation:** Demonstrate empathy by acknowledging the patient's emotions and validating their right to feel upset about their healthcare experience. Phrases like "It sounds incredibly frustrating to have felt dismissed" or "It makes sense that you'd be angry after this experience" can be helpful.
- **Problem-Solving:**  Collaboratively work with the patient to identify potential solutions for addressing their concerns. This could involve exploring alternative healthcare providers, advocating for better communication practices within the existing system, or developing coping strategies for managing anxiety related to future appointments.
