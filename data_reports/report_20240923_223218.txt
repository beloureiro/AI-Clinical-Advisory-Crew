Suggested_Approach_Clinical_Psychologist:
- Begin by expressing empathy and understanding towards the patient's frustration: "I understand you're feeling angry and frustrated after that experience. It's completely valid to feel upset when someone treats us rudely, especially when we're trying to access important healthcare services." 
- Help the patient identify coping mechanisms for dealing with similar situations in the future: "What are some things that usually help you feel calmer when you're feeling angry or frustrated? We can explore strategies together to manage these feelings effectively."
-  If appropriate, discuss alternative ways to make an appointment and offer reassurance about finding a helpful staff member: "Let me see if I can help you schedule an appointment with someone else. It's important that you feel comfortable and supported throughout this process."
