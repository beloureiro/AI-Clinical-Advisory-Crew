Patient Feedback: Despite an appointment, I had to wait 3 hours to be processed in 5 minutes. In the meantime, other patients simply left because the waiting time was too long. I also left after 2.5 hours at another appointment in March because otherwise I would have missed a train. 
Sometimes no one was called from the waiting room for over an hour. Very unfortunate. I had previously been treated by Ms. Soliman for a long time, but there was still no file. For me it was the first and last visit to Ms. Licheheb.
