# Agent: Clinical Psychologist
## Final Answer:
Emotional_State_Clinical_Psychologist: The patient expresses feelings of embarrassment, shame, anxiety, and frustration.  She is likely experiencing anger towards the healthcare professional for their lack of empathy and understanding. There may also be underlying worries about her son's well-being given his TDH diagnosis.

Support_Strategy_Clinical_Psychologist: A supportive and validating therapeutic approach is crucial. This involves actively listening to the patient's concerns without judgment, acknowledging her feelings of distress, and normalizing her experience.  The focus should be on empowering her to advocate for herself and her children in future healthcare settings. 

Suggested_Approach_Clinical_Psychologist:
- **Cognitive Restructuring:** Help the patient identify and challenge negative thoughts stemming from the encounter. Encourage her to reframe her perceptions of the situation, focusing on what she did well (e.g., managing two young children during an appointment) rather than dwelling on the healthcare professional's shortcomings. 
- **Behavioral Strategies:** Develop coping mechanisms for managing anxiety in future medical appointments. This could include relaxation techniques (deep breathing, mindfulness), positive self-talk, and role-playing scenarios to practice assertive communication with healthcare providers.  Additionally, explore strategies for managing her son's behavior during appointments, such as bringing familiar toys or engaging him in quiet activities.
