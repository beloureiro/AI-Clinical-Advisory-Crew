Emotional_State_Clinical_Psychologist: The patient feels frustrated, unheard, and potentially disempowered due to the healthcare professional's interruptions and lack of active listening.

Encouraging empathy from the healthcare professional and promoting open communication will help rebuild trust and foster a more supportive therapeutic relationship.

- Empathetically discuss the importance of allowing patients to express themselves fully without interruptions, emphasizing that their concerns are valued and will be addressed thoroughly.
- Encourage the patient to share their thoughts and feelings openly, assuring them of uninterrupted time for expression.
- If the healthcare professional interrupts, gently remind them of the importance of active listening and create a structure or visual aid (e.g., "three-minute talk" timer) to help maintain focus on the patient's narrative.
- Summarize the patient's main concerns and emotions to ensure understanding and validate their feelings throughout the process.
- Collaborate with the healthcare professional to develop a plan that addresses the patient's needs and concerns, focusing on empathy, open communication, and active listening going forward.
