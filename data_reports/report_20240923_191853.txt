# Agent: Clinical Psychologist
## Final Answer:
Emotional_State_Clinical_Psychologist: The patient expresses frustration, anger, and possibly a sense of helplessness. The wasted time, resources (gasoline and parking), and the lack of communication from the doctor likely contribute to these negative emotions.
Support_Strategy_Clinical_Psychologist: Validate the patient's feelings by acknowledging their experience and expressing empathy. Help them reframe their thoughts by focusing on what they can control and emphasizing that seeking support for emotional well-being is a positive step.  

Suggested_Approach_Clinical_Psychologist:
- **Active Listening:** Begin by actively listening to the patient's concerns, allowing them to fully express their feelings about the situation without interruption. Use verbal cues like "I understand your frustration" and "It sounds like you feel really let down" to demonstrate empathy. 
- **Cognitive Restructuring:**  Guide the patient through identifying negative thought patterns (e.g., "This is a complete waste of my time," "The doctor doesn't care about me"). Help them challenge these thoughts by asking questions that encourage a more balanced perspective. For example, you could ask, "Is there anything you can do to minimize the impact of this in the future?" or "What are some positive things that have happened recently despite this inconvenience?".
