# Agent: Health & IT Process Expert
## Final Answer:
Patient_Journey_Health_IT_Process_Expert:
- The patient journey began with scheduling an appointment for a dental or orthodontic service.
- A child arrived 10 minutes late due to the bus connection and was sent away without being seen, which resulted in no certificate from school being provided.

- Insufficient management of patient accounts to accommodate delayed bill payments without disrupting their access to necessary services.

- Implementing an automated rescheduling system for patients who are running late or face unforeseen delays (e.g., transportation issues).
- Establish clear communication protocols regarding appointment policies and any potential consequences of missing appointments, including school certificate implications.
- Develop a more robust patient account management process that allows for grace periods in bill payments without affecting service availability. 
- Implementing a system to allow patients to provide proof of late arrival (such as bus delay notifications) with the possibility to reschedule or offer alternative appointment times.
- Incorporating patient feedback mechanisms to identify and address specific needs, such as scheduling around school hours, to enhance overall satisfaction and reduce negative sentiment.
