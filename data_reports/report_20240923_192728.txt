Patient Feedback: Be careful when looking for a couples therapist, look for someone who really believes in marriage, after all, if we seek therapy for couples it is because we want to improve the relationship.
I paid to get divorced in the first therapy, “The worst of all the violence you can commit with a patient is to understand him too quickly” - Lacan
If you want to restore your marriage, look for a Christian therapist who believes in restoration. She looked at my husband and without understanding his side of the story put him in check to ask for a divorce. If we are looking for therapy, it is obvious that we are thinking about separation, but we are there to see the good side of marriage with the correct mediation. I don't recommend it!

# Agent: Clinical Psychologist
## Final Answer:
Emotional_State_Clinical_Psychologist: The patient expresses feelings of disappointment, anger, and betrayal towards the therapist. They feel misunderstood and unheard, which has exacerbated their emotional distress. There's also a sense of frustration with the therapy process and a desire for a supportive environment that encourages restoration within their marriage.  

Support_Strategy_Clinical_Psychologist: The patient requires a therapeutic approach centered on validating their emotions, rebuilding trust, and actively listening to their experiences. A collaborative and non-judgmental space is crucial to help them feel safe expressing their needs and concerns. 

Suggested_Approach_Clinical_Psychologist:
- **Initial Session:** Begin with empathetic validation of the patient's feelings about their previous therapy experience. Clearly communicate a commitment to understanding both perspectives within their marriage and collaboratively working towards restoration goals.  
- **Couple's Counseling (if desired):** If the patient is open to it, suggest couple's counseling with a therapist who specializes in relationship repair and demonstrates a belief in the potential for marital growth. Encourage open communication, active listening, and a focus on identifying strengths and areas for improvement within their relationship.

Issues_Identified_Communication_Expert:
- **Lack of empathy and understanding:** The therapist failed to consider the husband's perspective, jumping to conclusions about divorce without a thorough understanding of the situation.
- **Directive and prescriptive communication:** Instead of offering guidance and support, the therapist directed the patient towards divorce, which disregarded their stated desire to improve their marriage.  
Suggested_Improvements_Communication_Expert:
- **Active listening and perspective-taking:** Therapists should actively listen to both partners, striving to understand their individual experiences and viewpoints before offering advice or solutions. 
- **Collaborative and non-directive approach:** Therapy should be a collaborative process where the therapist guides the conversation and helps couples explore their options without imposing their own beliefs or opinions.
Final_Recommendation_Communication_Expert:  To improve communication in this scenario, therapists should prioritize empathy, active listening, and a non-directive approach. They should create a safe space for couples to express their feelings and concerns without judgment, ultimately empowering them to make informed decisions about their relationship.
