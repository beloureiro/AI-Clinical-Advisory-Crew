# Agent: Clinical Psychologist
## Final Answer:
Emotional_State_Clinical_Psychologist: The patient is experiencing a complex mix of emotions including humiliation, anger, betrayal, and possibly fear. They likely feel violated by the doctor's unprofessional behavior and are questioning their trust in healthcare professionals. This experience could also trigger feelings of vulnerability and self-doubt, especially if they were already seeking help for emotional or cognitive challenges.

Support_Strategy_Clinical_Psychologist: The primary support strategy should focus on validating the patient's feelings and rebuilding their sense of safety and trust.  This involves creating a supportive environment where they feel heard, understood, and respected. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques can be helpful in addressing negative thought patterns and building coping mechanisms to manage anxiety and fear related to future medical interactions.

Suggested_Approach_Clinical_Psychologist:
- **Validation and Empathy:** Begin by acknowledging the patient's feelings of anger, humiliation, and hurt.  Emphasize that their feelings are valid and understandable given the doctor's behavior. Reassure them that they are not alone in experiencing these emotions and that it is normal to feel upset after such a traumatic encounter.
- **Safety and Trust Building:**  Establish a safe and trusting therapeutic relationship by actively listening, being non-judgmental, and showing genuine care. Encourage open communication and create a space where the patient feels comfortable expressing their concerns and vulnerabilities without fear of judgment or criticism.
