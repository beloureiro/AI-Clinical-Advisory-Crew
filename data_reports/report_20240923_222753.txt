# Agent: Clinical Psychologist
## Final Answer:
Emotional_State_Clinical_Psychologist: The patient expresses profound anger, hurt, and disbelief. They feel violated and mistreated by the unprofessional behavior they experienced. Words like "subterranean," "listless," "unfriendly," and "unempathetic" indicate a deep sense of disappointment and emotional distress. 
Support_Strategy_Clinical_Psychologist: To address this emotional state, validation is crucial. Acknowledging their feelings as legitimate and understandable will create a safe space for them to express themselves further.  Thereafter, exploring the specific incidents that caused such distress can help identify triggers and coping mechanisms.
Suggested_Approach_Clinical_Psychologist:
- Begin by validating their feelings and expressing empathy for their experience. "It sounds like you had a very upsetting experience. I understand why you're feeling angry and hurt." 
- Gently guide them to describe the specific events that contributed to their negative emotions, allowing them to share their perspective without judgment.  
- Collaboratively explore coping mechanisms they can utilize in similar situations in the future. This could involve relaxation techniques, assertive communication strategies, or identifying support systems they can rely on.
