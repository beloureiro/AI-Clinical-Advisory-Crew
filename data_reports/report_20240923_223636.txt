Patient Feedback: It was my second colonoscopy for cancer prevention, unfortunately this time it was very painful. Even a few days later, the digestive system still does not function normally again. 10 euros for a "ventilation" of the intestine were withheld without an invoice; I didn't notice anything about the nasal tube described in the report. The address of my family doctor is wrong and I'm excited to see where the results will be sent. Unfortunately, there is no email address for the facility, so this would only be difficult to resolve by waiting a long time on the telephone loop. I was well informed and also free of fear (the first colonoscopy was painless and I was very well looked after in Munich). But for Berlin I can only recommend: If you can get an appointment somewhere else, do it there. It's becoming increasingly rare to have a choice in Berlin...

## Final Answer:
Emotional_State_Clinical_Psychologist:  The patient is experiencing a range of negative emotions including frustration, anger, anxiety, and a sense of helplessness.
