Patient Feedback: NEVER AGAIN! I don't criticize the doctor himself. Unfortunately, we were already rejected at the reception. Despite the emergency (retinal detachment), they didn't want to accept us. We were told that we didn't know whether that was really the case and that the family doctors would tell us a lot.  They then wanted to clarify with the doctor whether they wanted to see my husband at all, since I argued with them and they found it very disturbing... and then disappeared... then came back with the statement that it can take a long time... at least 1.5 hours.... The two ladies couldn't be topped in terms of unfriendliness, lack of empathy and unprofessionalism. We then drove to the eye clinic. There was a correct response to the diagnosis and my husband was treated immediately. By the way, always friendly and empathetic!

# Agent: Clinical Psychologist
## Final Answer:
Emotional_State_Clinical_Psychologist: The patient expresses feelings of anger, frustration, helplessness, and relief. They are clearly upset by the dismissive and unprofessional treatment they received at the first healthcare facility, highlighting the impact on their emotional well-being. However, the positive experience at the eye clinic brought them a sense of relief and validation. 
Support_Strategy_Clinical_Psychologist: Validate the patient's feelings, acknowledge the distress caused by the negative experience, and provide reassurance that their reaction is understandable given the circumstances. Help the patient process their anger and frustration constructively while focusing on the positive outcome at the eye clinic.  

Suggested_Approach_Clinical_Psychologist:
- Encourage the patient to express their emotions openly and without judgment. 
- Reflect back their feelings to show empathy and understanding ("It sounds incredibly frustrating to be dismissed when you were clearly experiencing an emergency").
- Help them identify coping mechanisms for dealing with anger and frustration, such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness techniques. 
-  Shift the focus to the positive experience at the eye clinic, acknowledging the relief and competence they encountered there.
