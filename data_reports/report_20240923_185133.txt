Patient Feedback: My complaint is not about Dr. Mayara, as I actually only had praise for her work. But I gave up on scheduling my private appointment due to the terrible service provided by the secretary who treated me with great rudeness and disregard. I thought it was important to report my dissatisfaction because I imagine that, like me, other patients may give up seeing the doctor for the same reason.

# Agent: Clinical Psychologist
## Final Answer:
Emotional_State_Clinical_Psychologist: The patient expresses feelings of frustration, anger, and disappointment due to the secretary's rude and dismissive behavior.  There is also a sense of helplessness as they felt unable to resolve the issue and had to abandon their appointment. This experience likely contributes to feelings of distrust towards the medical office and potentially impacts their overall trust in healthcare providers.

Support_Strategy_Clinical_Psychologist: A supportive and validating approach is crucial. Acknowledge the patient's valid frustration and anger while reframing their experience as a solvable problem. Help them identify coping mechanisms for managing their emotions, such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness techniques, to reduce feelings of helplessness. Encourage open communication about their concerns and empower them to advocate for themselves in future interactions with the medical office.

Suggested_Approach_Clinical_Psychologist:
- **Active Listening and Validation:**  Begin by actively listening to the patient's experience without judgment. Reflect their feelings back to them, demonstrating empathy and understanding. For example, "It sounds incredibly frustrating to have your concerns dismissed in that way." 
- **Empowerment and Problem Solving:** Guide the patient through brainstorming potential solutions. Help them identify steps they can take to address the situation, such as requesting a different secretary or speaking with a supervisor. Encourage them to advocate for themselves while maintaining a respectful tone.
