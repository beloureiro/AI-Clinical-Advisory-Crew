Patient Feedback: If you are esoteric, therapy is recommended. But I felt strange when the psychologist talked about herself. That she demanded sterilization from her ex in order not to pass on her trauma, how she was conceived, men's problems or that women over 50 have more desire. I was disgusted by it. I got gifts from her. At the same time, somehow too much. Seemed inauthentic. Felt like I owed something. Then she kept asking for favors. Pull or clean weeds before the practice. I had to approach criticism very carefully. She immediately dismisses it or blames everything on the patient's problems. She suddenly no longer wants to remember a lot of what she said. She often tried to pressure me into making decisions. You should have very firm boundaries. I found out from other patients that she was talking about me. Confidentiality? I obviously missed some big red flags.
